# Autonomous-Vacuum-Cleaning-Robot-Simulation-using-live-SLAM
This project features an autonomous robot that builds maps with Live SLAM, detects obstacles using LIDAR, and follows a Full Coverage Path Planning (CCPP) algorithm for systematic cleaning. If a cell is unreachable, it falls back to A* search and makes intelligent navigation decisions in real time. It also has custom built launch file. This algorithm is built with custom logic for obstacle detection, live navigation, and intelligent movement â€” all built in ROS and tested on a real TurtleBot3.
